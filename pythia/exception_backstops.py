"""watch_game_errors(): turns an exception in a Game method into the game's
error signal and a stop, instead of letting it propagate.

The GTK-era backstops that wrapped every GObject signal handler and idle
callback went with pythia/gui (3d35494); the web UI reports failures through
its own log and error console.
